TODO
----

permissions need to consider that not everyone should be able to email anyone
email needs to be granted to only certain users
other users may only be able to email themselves

we may need multiple users to be logged in at the same time

some data will need table level permissions, some data will need row based permissions


resources need to be able to check permissions themselves
- have an easy way to assign permission for a user or set of users to use something all together
- tokens that everyone can share -- no need to reimplement this

have requests pass in two tokens: authentication and permissions
user can have multiple permissions tokens -- need to know when to use the right one
permissions to resources or entire tables may be downloaded/retreived during authentication
row based permissions may require two calls, one to get the token and one to get the data
